SpaceX Launch Explorer is an interactive web application designed to let you explore detailed information about past and upcoming SpaceX launches. Leveraging a free API (such as the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)), the app dynamically fetches launch data and presents it in a sleek, responsive interface. Whether you're a space enthusiast or a curious learner, SpaceX Launch Explorer offers insights on launch dates, mission details, rocket information, and more—all at your fingertips.

## Features

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

SpaceX Launch Explorer runs in modern web browsers without any additional dependencies. For development purposes, it is recommended to use a code editor with live reload functionality (e.g., Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/spacex-launch-explorer.git cd spacex-launch-explorer


2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live-reload server via your code editor for real-time preview.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses JavaScript’s Fetch API to retrieve launch data from the free SpaceX API. The JSON response is parsed and rendered dynamically to create informative launch cards.
- **Launch Details:** Each card displays key mission details such as launch date, mission name, rocket used, and a mission patch image. Clicking a card opens a modal with comprehensive mission details.
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Users can easily filter launches by their status (upcoming or past) and sort them based on various parameters to quickly find the information they need.
- **Responsive Interface:** Designed with Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS, the application adapts seamlessly to any device, ensuring a smooth exploration experience.
